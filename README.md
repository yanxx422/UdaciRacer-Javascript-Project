# Welcome to the One and only UdaciRacer Simulation Game

## Project Introduction

This is a game which allows a user to race a simulated racer. Players will get to choose their racer and the track they want to race on. The strategy of the game is for each player to choose a pod racer they expect to win over a certain race track based on the pod’s characteristics (acceleration, handling, and top speed).

This racing game runs as a Node application and it is the third project of Udacity Intermediate JavaScript Program.

The game mechanics are this: you select a player and track, the game begins and you accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. As you accelerate so do the other players and the leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. The final view is a results page displaying the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:

1. The form to create a race

2. The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)

3. The race results view

## Getting Started


### Start the Server

The game engine has been compiled down to a binary so that you can run it on any system. Because of this, you cannot edit the API in any way, it is just a black box that we interact with via the API endpoints.

To run the server, locate your operating system and run the associated command in your terminal at the root of the project.

| Your OS               | Command to start the API                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac                   | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-osx`   |
| Windows               | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server.exe`   |
| Linux (Ubuntu, etc..) | `ORIGIN_ALLOWED=http://localhost:3000 ./bin/server-linux` |

Note that this process will use your terminal tab, so you will have to open a new tab and navigate back to the project root to start the front end.

#### WINDOWS USERS -- Setting Environment Variables
If you are using a windows machine:
1. `cd` into the root of the project containing data.json 
2. Run the following command to add the environment variable:
```set DATA_FILE=./data.json```

If you still run into issues running the API server on your machine, you can run this project in the Udacity classroom.


### Start the Frontend

First, run your preference of `npm install && npm start` or `yarn && yarn start` at the root of this project. Then you should be able to access http://localhost:3000.


### API Calls

Below are a list of the API endpoints and the shape of the data they return. These are all of the endpoints you need to complete the game. Consult this information often as you complete the project:

[GET] `api/tracks`
List of all tracks

- id: number (1)
- name: string ("Track 1")
- segments: number[]([87,47,29,31,78,25,80,76,60,14....])

[GET] `api/cars`
List of all cars

- id: number (3)
- driver_name: string ("Racer 1")
- top_speed: number (500)
- acceleration: number (10)
- handling: number (10)

[GET] `api/races/${id}`
Information about a single race

- status: RaceStatus ("unstarted" | "in-progress" | "finished")
- positions object[] ([{ car: object, final_position: number (omitted if empty), speed: number, segment: number}])

[POST] `api/races`
Create a race

- id: number
- track: string
- player_id: number
- cars: Cars[] (array of cars in the race)
- results: Cars[] (array of cars in the position they finished, available if the race is finished)

[POST] `api/races/${id}/start`
Begin a race

- Returns nothing

[POST] `api/races/${id}/accelerate`
Accelerate a car

- Returns nothing
